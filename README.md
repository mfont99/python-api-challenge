Module 6 challenge assignment

Most of the code was relatively straightforward, however I struggled a lot on the map creation, just because I have had a lot of issues with my imports for some reason. I've used Xpert Learning Assistant to try to fix the errors, but I haven't been able to. That being said, I've run the same code blocks that are making the maps on other machines, and they work fine. So hopefully whoever is grading this can get it to work on their end. Everything else worked fine though and was smooth.
